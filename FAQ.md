# NEAR Lands Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the end goal of the project?

It's going to be a 2d metaverse where everyone can build something. 

Think Roblox/Minecraft/Cryptovoxels but in 2D and with world stored on chain

So that somebody can build their own place and connect it to various smart contracts, APIs, etc to create interactive experience.
One of first projects building is https://twitter.com/NEARHolystic

## How can I buy land?

Right now there is no land available for sale.
However you can get land for free as long as you also build something cool.

## Wen land sale?

Depends on how fast we build a town together.

Current plan is to distribute initial grants of land to builders with best project proposals. 
After these initial grants are distributed there gonna be public NFT sale of land. 

The idea is that we build out something of value as community first. And once it's fun palce to hang out we can launch land market.
