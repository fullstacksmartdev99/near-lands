## When blockchain makes sense

### Monetizing UGC (user generated content)

Some games provide a way for users to create custom content:
 - maps
 - textures
 - characters
 - minigames
 - various mods affecting either rendering or gameplay
 
Quite often these don't come with any native way to monetize, so a lot of creative people who contribute to community don't get paid for it.
Some games have provided such ability (e.g. Roblox). However there are some drawbacks:
 - revenue share system biased towards platform
 - no guarantee that system can work beyond one parent company
Basically the system is still owned by one private company vs players themselves.

With blockchain you can have everything owned by community and allow creators to get paid directly.

    - Roblox
    - Minecraft

Web3:

NEAR:
    - NEAR Lands
    - Marble Place
    - Shroom Kingdom

### Permanent ownership of land / items / characters (i.e. NFT-like stuff)

### Turn based (or semi-realtime) multiplayer with high stakes

Note that this doesn't have to be turn based only in a classic sense (like e.g. chess). A minimum viable "turn" for blockchain game is a time it takes to produce one block and confirm a transaction, which in case of NEAR is around 1 second. So there are games like Berry Club where you can essentialy decide to make or not to make a turn at any given moment and it feels somewhat realtime. However everyone's turns are still going to be executed sequentially on blockchain.

This can potentially work for a very diverse spectrum of games. A chess match between trusted friends which has some money on stake to make it more interesting. Or a massively multiplayer stategy game where players all around the world compete for scarce resources.

    - EVE Online
    - Online poker?
    - etc

Web3: 
    - Dark Forest
    - ???

NEAR:
    - Berry Club

### Keep massively multiplayer world running forever (as long as players care)

It's often a pleasure to play old 80s and 90s games as you can run them easily on various emulators. These games gonna stay with us forver.
Unfortunately it's completely different with massively multiplayer online games. It's all over once publisher decides to shut down the servers. So a lot of culture from 2000s and 2010s games gonna be lost forever (at least in it's dynamic form), which is a shale.

Decentralized tech allows you to build massively multiplayer worlds which can go on forever. Or at least until there are users who care and are willing to pay for compute.

### Trading card games

### Governance games

Web2:

    - Wikipedia ;)

You can imagine adopting some games into "play by DAO" mode, e.g. collective of multiple humans deciding chess moves playing against Kasparov

### Provably unique experiences (e.g. dungeon crawler where you get one shot to go through given dungeon and your adventure is recorded as NFT)
